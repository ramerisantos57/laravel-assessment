### Resource Details

| POST  | /tours | Creates new tours |
| PUT  | /tours/{id} | Update or create specific tours data |
| DELETE  | /tours/{id} | Delete tours data |

#### Filtering

|Filter|Operator|Route example|
|-|-|-|
|price|eq,lte,gte|`/tours?price[eq]=100`|
|start|eq,lte,gte|`/tours?start[eq]=2020-01-20T00:00:00`|
|end|eq,lte,gte|`/tours?end[eq]=2020-01-20T00:00:00`|

- lte = less than or equal to
- gte = greater than or equal to
- eq = equal

#### Pagination

- Use soft delete trait.
- Use JSON format.
- Write  Unit tests for your API is a plus!

Good luck!
